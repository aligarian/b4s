# Rest API with JWT authentication and role based authorization using TypeScript


I have used TypeScript Express.js and TypeORM to create an Rest API with JWT authentication and role based authorization. 


## Why TypeORM?

It is compatible with MySQL / MariaDB / Postgres / SQLite / Microsoft SQL Server / Oracle / sql.js / MongoDB. We can switch between those databases without having to rewrite your code.

I have used SQLite.

## just start the server.

    npm start

## Please create admin user for login?

    npm run migration:run
